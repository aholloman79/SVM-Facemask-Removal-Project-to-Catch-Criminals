Catching Criminals Robbing Mailbox Keys Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in R Studio
In today's world, mail theft has become a serious issue, especially with criminals targeting mailbox keys to steal sensitive information. As part of a project aimed at addressing this problem, I am leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in R Studio to detect and identify criminals involved in robbing mailbox keys. CNNs are a powerful class of deep learning models widely used in image processing and pattern recognition tasks, making them suitable for this objective.

The goal of this project is to create a robust system capable of automatically identifying suspicious activity around mailboxes, flagging potential criminal behavior, and providing law enforcement with valuable insights. Here's an overview of my approach using CNNs in R Studio:

Data Collection and Preprocessing
The first step in this process is gathering relevant data. For the purpose of this project, I use video footage from security cameras installed around mailboxes. The footage serves as the dataset, containing various scenes with and without criminal activity.

Using the opencv and imager libraries in R, I convert these videos into individual frames, which are then labeled as either "normal activity" or "suspicious activity" (such as someone tampering with a mailbox). Each frame is preprocessed, including resizing and normalization, to ensure consistency across the dataset. Preprocessing is crucial to prepare the data for input into the CNN model.

Building the CNN Model in R Studio
Convolutional Neural Networks are designed to automatically learn and detect features from images. For this project, I use the keras library in R, which provides an intuitive interface for building deep learning models. My CNN model consists of several key layers:

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply filters to detect features in the images, such as edges, shapes, or patterns associated with criminal activity.
Pooling Layers: These layers down-sample the image, reducing its dimensionality while retaining the most important features.
Fully Connected Layers: After flattening the image, the model uses fully connected layers to classify the images as "normal" or "suspicious activity."
The CNN architecture is built using multiple convolutional and pooling layers, with the final output being a softmax layer that predicts the probability of criminal behavior in a given frame.


# Example CNN Model in R using keras
library(keras)

model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_conv_2d(filters = 32, kernel_size = c(3, 3), activation = "relu", input_shape = c(64, 64, 3)) %>%
  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2, 2)) %>%
  layer_conv_2d(filters = 64, kernel_size = c(3, 3), activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2, 2)) %>%
  layer_flatten() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_dense(units = 2, activation = "softmax")

model %>% compile(
  loss = "categorical_crossentropy",
  optimizer = optimizer_adam(),
  metrics = c("accuracy")
)
Training the Model
Once the model architecture is defined, I proceed to train the CNN on the labeled data. Using supervised learning, the model learns to distinguish between normal and suspicious activities by adjusting its internal parameters during training. The dataset is split into training and validation sets, allowing the model to learn from one set and validate its performance on the other.


# Training the CNN Model
history <- model %>% fit(
  train_images, train_labels,
  epochs = 10,
  batch_size = 32,
  validation_data = list(validation_images, validation_labels)
)
Evaluation and Optimization
After training, the model's accuracy and performance are evaluated on a test set. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure the model's ability to correctly identify criminal activity while minimizing false positives. I also perform hyperparameter tuning by adjusting the learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs to improve the model's performance.

Deployment and Application
The final step is deploying the trained CNN model in a real-time application. The system can be integrated into existing security camera infrastructure, where it processes live video feeds and detects suspicious activities around mailboxes. When the model identifies potential criminal behavior, it sends alerts to authorities, enabling timely intervention.

Conclusion
Using Convolutional Neural Networks in R Studio presents an effective method for detecting criminal activity around mailboxes. By training the CNN on video footage, the system can automatically learn to identify suspicious behavior, helping law enforcement agencies prevent mailbox key thefts. This project demonstrates the power of deep learning techniques in enhancing public safety and solving real-world problems.
